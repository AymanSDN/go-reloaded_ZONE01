it (cap) was the best of times, it was the worst of times (up) , it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness (cap, 6) , it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, IT WAS THE (low, 3) winter of despair.

Simply add 42 (hex) and 10 (bin) and you will see the result is 68.

There is no greater agony than bearing a untold story inside you.

Punctuation tests are ... kinda boring ,don't you think !?

------------------------------------------------------------
If I make you BREAKFAST IN BED (low, 3) just say thank you instead of: how (cap) did you get in my house (up, 2) ?

I have to pack 101 (bin) outfits. Packed 1a (hex) just to be sure

Don not be sad ,because sad backwards is das . And das not good
